# My-Notes

This repository contains my inspired noteskins. Each branch is exclusive to a game mode.
Some of them contain judgements.

They are supported on OutFox and StepMania 5+ depending on the game mode support.

## Installation

  1. Clone the repository.
  2. Checkout a game mode branch.
  3. Copy the noteskins and judgements in their respective folders.
